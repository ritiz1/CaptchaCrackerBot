# Bot Registration Automation

This script automates the process of creating multiple user accounts on a website by bypassing CAPTCHA challenges using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

## Features
- Creates multiple accounts with fake credentials
- Solves simple text-based CAPTCHAs using Tesseract OCR
- Handles HTTP sessions and form field extraction

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Dependencies: requests, beautifulsoup4, pillow, pytesseract, faker

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pillow pytesseract faker
```

2. Configure Tesseract OCR path (replace with your installation path):
```python
TESSERACT_CMD = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"  # Update this path
```

3. Update the base URL (replace with your target website):
```python
BASE_URL = "http://example.com"  # Replace with actual URL
```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
```bash
python bot.py
```

2. The script will:
   - Scrape the registration page form fields
   - Solve CAPTCHA using OCR
   - Submit registration forms with fake data
   - Repeat for specified number of accounts

## Limitations
- Works only with simple text-based CAPTCHAs
- May require manual adjustments for specific website structures
- OCR accuracy depends on CAPTCHA image quality

## Important Notes
- This script is for educational purposes only
- Do not use for malicious activities
- Website terms of service should be respected

## Example Output
```
Username: johndoe123, Password: p@ssw0rd!
Account 1 created successfully!
Username: janedoe456, Password: secureP@ss!
Account 2 created successfully!
...
```

## Improvement Ideas
- Add proxy support for different IP addresses
- Implement more sophisticated CAPTCHA solving techniques
- Add error handling for failed registrations
- Include headless browser automation for complex CAPTCHAs
